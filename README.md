This website is built with love in React.
It was initially made with native JS, HTML and CSS - and recently ported to ReactJS.

## Technology behind

Brief list of technology used.

### `ReactJS`

The website is mainly built with Facebook JS Framwork 'React'.
This is a common framework used by professionals, and one of my personal favorites.

### `Netlify`

I've connected the website to my github through Netlify.
This means I can push commits to git and immediately build production builds to my domain through Netlify.

You can read more about Netfliy here (https://www.netlify.com/)
